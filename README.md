# WSU CptS-360

The Labs and the Final Project for CptS 360 Spring 2016 semester. CptS 360 was a daunting systems programming class taught by the esteemed Professor K.C. Wang that had a drop rate of 50%.

- **Introduction to Unix/Linux and MTX Operating Systems**                                                                                                                                                    
     Files, directories, special files, logical organization of 
     Unix file system; user account, login process and command
     execution.

- **Program development**

     linker, library and executable files; loader and execution 
     images. Symbolic debugger and run-time support.

- **Execution image of C programs**

     stack frames and parameter passing; long jumps.

- **File I/O**
     System calls and low-level file I/O; open, close, read, write, 
     lseek, file descriptors and file sharing. Execution of User 
     mode and Kernel mode images, implementation and implications 
     of system calls.

- **File Control**

     and soft links, file status and statistics. 
     I/O redirection, pipes, filters and applications.

- **Standard I/O Library**

     relationship with low-level I/O,  char and line mode I/O. 
     Formatted I/O.

- **File system implementation**
     Inodes and file representation; mkfs and physical file 
     system layout; traversal of the file system tree; booting 
     system images.

- **Processes**
     Concept and implementation of processes, process execution 
     environment, user mode and kernel mode images, process
     states transitions. Processes in the Unix system; init, 
     login and user processes.

- **Process Control**
     fork, vfork, wait, exit, kill, exec operations. traps and 
     signal handling.
