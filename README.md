The Labs and the Final Project for CptS 360 Spring 2016 semester. CptS 360 was the daunting systems programming class taught by the esteemed Professor K.C. Wang. This course had a drop rate of 50%.

The goal was to build a ext2 file system with C that handled basic unix commands. Each lab built upon it.
